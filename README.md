# LC3 Disassembler

This is a basic work-in-progress disassembler for LC3 assembly.
This program takes an assembled binary file (usually .obj) and scans the data to print out all the instructions present in the LC3 assembly language.

There is no support for adding symbols yet; this will come at a later point in time.
The assembly instructions print successfully, and by modifying main.c, you can choose whether to print the instructions in hexidecimal, binary, or in LC3 assembly.

Feel free to improve the code I've written here; this was done as a little project on the side for fun.
